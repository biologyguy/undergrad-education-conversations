Conversations about teaching computational skills to undergraduates

This repostitory has been created as an extension of a 'Birds of a Feather' discussion at the
2017 iEvoBio conference, where ideas about where bandied about for building new undergraduate
bioinformatics ciricula. We wanted a centralized place to put those ideas, but also wanted to make
sure they were accessible to the broader community. Thank you GitHub :)

If you have ideas or would like to contribute to the discussion, please do so in [the issue
tracker](https://github.com/carpentries/undergrad-education-conversations/issues). Below are bullet
points posing questions and describing the general flow of our discussion, which will be adapted into more coherant
issues shortly.

* Is there some cost associated with teaching undergrads the traditionally memory
intensive biology content at the same time as the more logic focused computational content?
* How do we deal with coding fear?
  * The very first skill students require is to not be terrified
  * Semester long SWC/DC-esk course(s) very early
* Continue to incorporate computation throughout all or most core curriculum
  * We need curricula road maps; identify the short, medium, and long term learning objectives, and
make a plan to get there.
* 'Bioinformatics' is broad, so what commonalities can be extracted to give students the best
framework for branching into more specialized topics later?
  * Basic coding skills
  * Basic shell tools
  * Focus on what to do with tabular data, statistics, modelling, noisy matrices
  * Teach students to troubleshoot and to learn form manuals/formums/peers/etc
  * Dos and don'ts for basic script design (antipatterns)
